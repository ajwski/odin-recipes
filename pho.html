    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This traditional pho recipe uses beef bones, fish sauce, star anise, and ginger to create a delicious aromatic Vietnamese broth from scratch. The flavorful broth is ladled over rice noodles and thinly sliced beef and topped with fresh garnishes. As with many foods, the origins of pho are unknown. It is believed to have been created in northern Vietnam in the early 20th century. It gained popularity in many countries after the Vietnam War.</p>
